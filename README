This is a script that helps with the tedious task of publishing a Google doc in html form to a static website on a webserver controlled by you. This automates the following steps into a single command:

- Going to Google docs and exporting the document
- Downloading the resulting zip file and unzipping it somewhere
- FTPing the contents to the webserver

This process that took minutes now takes seconds. To be honest this probably isn't actually that useful, but I've found a couple of uses for it.

Dependencies:

- Google Docs Python API

That's it!
